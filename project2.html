<center><p class="mb-0">​The assignment was to modify an existing template, so I decided to take a solid lamp template and adjust the base to make it just the outer shell. My inspiration behind this change was an LED lamp, where I could insert a light inside and it could light up the lamp. This would not be possible with a solid lamp, which is why I chose to modify the base to a shell. While the template did come with a top for the lamp, I chose to create a curved top versus a straight cylinder. Designing the lamp in TinkerCad was fairly easy, although I found myself frustrated by the software's limitations. I exported the design as an STL to PrusaSlicer, where I adjusted the design to allow for two color changes.

The trouble came after I began printing and already had a color change. I'd printed the design with an infil of 20%, but the Prusa MINI+ started to make circles of fillament smaller than the previous loop. Therefore, the fillament made lines in the middle of the print instead of continuing the circular lamp. I decided to try printing with 70% infil to see if there would still be a printing error.</p>

<center><p class="mb-0">​There are not many noticeable differences between the 20% and the 70% infill, because the ‘walls’ of the lamp are so thin that infill was not very necessary. The same print error happened in both lamps, but it wasn’t noticeable and didn’t have any effect on the lamp itself. As the lamp size was scaled down for this test print, a light does not fit inside, but it lights up rather nicely when a flashlight is placed underneath. Light colored filament was specifically chosen for this purpose, but if printing a real lamp, translucent or transparent filament would be preferred.

                        <center><p class="mb-0">​I chose to print an earring holder to test the limits of the Prusa MINI+, although I didn't include the supports that the design recommended. As the earring holder is tall and includes bars acros the piece, foregoing the support meant that the bars did not form correctly. Without the support at the bottom, they sunk, with individual strings of fillament bending instead of creating one smooth bridge across. The Prusa Slicer software recognized that supports were needed, and flashed me a warning when I went to download the G Code. However, as the point of the project was to explore the limits of the printers, I ignored the warning, however I was impressed by the software's ability to recognize errors. 

                        From my observations of the printed earring holder, which was shaped similar to a graveyard headstone, I noticed something intersting about how the four bars printed. The top bar and the bottom bar, which had the smallest length, had sunken the least. The middle two bars, which were longer, both had considerably sunken, to the point where the individual strings were evident from feet away. This makes sense as the longer a bar is, the less support the middle receives from the sides, and the more likely it is to droop. </p><br>
